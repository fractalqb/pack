# Intro

For Go packages it is common and good style to have packages
installabel with a simple `go get...` command. This is supported in a
great way by having so many good tools being part of the Go
distribution. However sometimes applications might require to be
distributed as a binary package with a crafted distribution file-tree
– especially when users are not expected to compile the application
themselves.

To have a portable way to pack such a distribution one would need a
portable runtime for the program that does the packing. So why not
write the packing program in Go? Most of the batteries are already
included in Go but IMHO they could use a little polishing,
i.e. lifting the API abstraction, to make the packing code even more
simple. And exactly that's what this package is provided for!

## By the way…

There is just a little tool included to create a source file with
constants defining the current version of the package. The idea is
extraordinary simple: Write down the version parameters in a separate
text file, e.g. `VERSION`, from which not only the Go code can be
generated but that also can likely be processed by a lot of other
programs too, e.g. shell, makefiles, Python and many others:

```shell
major=0
minor=2
bugfix=0
quality="a"
```

With such a simple file and one `go generate` directive, e.g. in an
application's `main.go`

```go
package main
…
//go:generate versioner ./VERSION ./version.go
…
```

a simple `go generate` will create the file `version.go` from the file
`VERSION`:

```go
package main

const (
	Major = 0
	Minor = 2
	Bugfix = 0
	Quality = "a"
)
```

and with this its trivial to let `myfancyprogram` show you its version
like this

```go
myfancyprogram v0.2.0a
Usage: [flags] input output
…
```

There are also some flags to define a common prefix for the constants,
to have automatically increasing build numbers and to generate a
timestamp from `time.Now()`.

# Install
To get the library for writing your packing program:

`go get -u git.fractalqb.de/fractalqb/pack`

To get the `versioner` binary:

`go install -u git.fractalqb.de/fractalqb/pack/versioner`
